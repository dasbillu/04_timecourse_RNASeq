"GO:1990116","ribosome-associated ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process","biological_process","The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the breakdown of a protein or peptide encoded by an aberrant message and associated with a stalled ribosome. Degradation is initiated by the covalent attachment of a ubiquitin group, or multiple ubiquitin groups, to the ribosome-associated protein."
"GO:1990246","uniplex complex","cellular_component","A calcium channel complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane capable of highly-selective calcium channel activity. Its components include the EF-hand-containing proteins mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1) and MICU2, the pore-forming subunit mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU) and its paralog MCUb, and the MCU regulator EMRE."
"GO:1990316","Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex","cellular_component","A protein complex consisting of Atg1 (or Atg1 homologs e.g. ULK1, ULK2 in mammals) and Atg13 along with other proteins that regulate its function (e.g. Atg17 in yeast or RB1CC1(FIP200) in mammals). This complex has serine/threonine protein kinase activity and is involved in autophagosome formation."
"GO:1990423","RZZ complex","cellular_component","A kinetochore component required for both meiotic and mitotic spindle assembly checkpoints."
"GO:1990456","mitochondrion-endoplasmic reticulum membrane tethering","biological_process","The attachment of a mitochondrion and an endoplasmic reticulum via molecular tethers that physically bridge their respective membranes and attach them to each other. The tethering may facilitate exchange of metabolites between the organelles."
"GO:1990504","dense core granule exocytosis","biological_process","The secretion of molecules (e.g. neuropeptides, insulin-related peptides or neuromodulators such as serotonin and dopamine) contained within a membrane-bounced dense core granule by fusion of the granule with the plasma membrane of a cell in response to increased cytosolic calcium levels."
"GO:1990745","EARP complex","cellular_component","A quatrefoil tethering complex required for endocytic recycling."
"GO:1990817","RNA adenylyltransferase activity","molecular_function","Catalysis of the template-independent extension of the 3'- end of an RNA strand by addition of one adenosine molecule at a time. Cannot initiate a chain 'de novo'. The primer, depending on the source of the enzyme, may be an RNA, or oligo(A) bearing a 3'-OH terminal group."
"GO:2000431","regulation of cytokinesis, actomyosin contractile ring assembly","biological_process","Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cytokinesis, actomyosin contractile ring assembly."
"GO:2000574","regulation of microtubule motor activity","biological_process","Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of microtubule motor activity."
"GO:2000601","positive regulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation","biological_process","Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation."
"GO:2001070","starch binding","molecular_function","Interacting selectively and non-covalently with starch."
